## üöÄ The Problem

Managing weekly grocery shopping is often disorganized. People forget items, struggle with meal ideas, and don't have an easy way to track their list. Our AI Grocery Helper solves this by acting as a smart assistant to make grocery shopping simple and efficient.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Smart List Management:** Easily add or clear items from your list.
- **Weekly Meal Planner:** Automatically generate a 7-day dinner plan and a corresponding grocery list with a single click.
- **Intelligent Organization:** Ask the AI to organize your list by common supermarket aisles to make shopping faster.
- **Price Estimation:** Get a rough estimate of your total grocery bill.
- **Clean UI:** A dedicated, clean list is always visible in the sidebar for easy reference.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Challenges & Our Pivot Story

This hackathon required the mandatory use of the Portia AI platform. We began by attempting to integrate Portia, but were completely blocked by a critical bug on their platform: the core functionality to create an agent was missing from our account's user interface.

After documenting this show-stopping issue with screenshots, we made an executive engineering decision to pivot. To deliver a high-quality, functional project, we built our application using the Google Gemini API. This journey demonstrates our ability to diagnose critical issues and adapt quickly to overcome technical roadblocks, a key skill in any real-world development environment.
